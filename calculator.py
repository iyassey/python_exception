#create a for loop that will ask the user for two numbers

#create an inner while loop and ask the user for their desire mathematical operations that is limited to addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication

#this block of code will execute if the user chose addition

#this block of code will execute if the user chose subtraction

#this block of code will execute if the user chose multiplication

#this block of code will execute if the user chose division

#this block of code will execute if the user chose an operation that is not included in the choices

#this block of code will execute if the program will detect a zero division error

#ask the user if they want to create a text file
#if the user wants to create a text file, they can choose if they want to append or write a text file
